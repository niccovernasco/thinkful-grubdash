Hello there. Thanks for checking out my awesome app. The part of the app that I implemented was this Restful API. It uses a Postgresql database for persistent storage and a robust architecture revolving around controllers and services. I used Knex to build the SQL queries. The framework I used was NodeJs + Express.
